> In an effort to learn React I have created an ecommerce store. Pulls a list of products from state and displays them in the DOM. You can add items to cart, the cart is persisted in local storage. You can also edit the items in inventory. Items in inventory are persisted using firebase. User Authentication is enabled for inventory
